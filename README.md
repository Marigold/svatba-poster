# Shader Poster

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/atzedent/pen/YzJeXYJ](https://codepen.io/atzedent/pen/YzJeXYJ).

It's a recreation of a poster, but instead of using images, I used some shaders. Actually, there are two fragment shaders, one of which represents different solids with different parameter values.

The poster can be found [here](https://archinect.imgix.net/uploads/73/73hjh6akgs7lmtqt.jpg)
